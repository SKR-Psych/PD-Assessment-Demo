# PD-Assessment-Demo
Test game for PD assessment in UPDRS. Trying to see if I can vibe code out something based on my Spec:

Scoring Elements

1 – Grasping

Prehension: reach, grasp, transport, accurate release. Includes aperture scaling to object size and controlled placement.

Related to Part III items for hand opening/closing and object manipulation; assesses fine–gross grip coordination.

Picking and placing objects into hive cells.

Sorting Board – Waist-height board with 3 coloured apertures of different diameters; balls of varying size/colour drop down chutes.

Player reaches for ball, forms correct grip, transports to matching aperture, inserts, releases. Left/right hands tested separately via spawn position.

Accuracy: correct colour + size match. Placement error: distance from hole centre at release. Completion time per ball. Throughput: objects/minute.

2 – Finger Dexterity

Rapid, alternating thumb–index pinching; measures speed, amplitude, rhythm, and decrement over repetitions.

Part III finger tapping (items 3.4a/b).

Feeding larvae by dropping pollen.

Firefly Catcher – Fireflies hover above a jar; pinch to “catch” and drop them in.

Fireflies spawn in position matched to active hand. Pinching closes net, firefly drops into jar; consistent pinches spawn bonus fireflies.

Count caught, rhythm consistency (variation in inter-tap intervals), mean pinch amplitude, miss rate.

3 – Wrist Rotation

Pronation–supination range and smoothness; may also include controlled flexion/extension to position an object.

Part III pronation–supination of hands (item 3.6a/b).

Drying nectar with controlled wing motion.

Magic Orb Charger – Rotate a glowing orb to align floating runes; hold alignment to charge it, then fire a light beam.

Orb appears in active hand zone; player rotates wrist to align runes; hold steady to charge. Opposite rotations for each hand’s trial.

Max rotation reached (° from neutral), time in alignment zone, charge completion speed, smoothness index from rotation data.

4 – Sustained Alternating Rotation

Repeated large-amplitude pronation–supination with a steady rhythm to test endurance and amplitude maintenance.

Part III pronation–supination with observation for decrement.

Drying nectar repeatedly to evaporate water.

Windmill Spinner – Alternate wrist rotation to keep windmill at target speed and generate energy.

Windmill slows if rotation amplitude/rhythm drops; target speed indicated visually; bonus for long streaks without drop-off.

Rotation count, average range per rotation, time at target speed, cadence stability (variance in rotation period).
